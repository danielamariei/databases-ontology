An ontology is a model for a particular domain. What should be included in the 
ontology should be determined according to how the ontology will be used.

Basic qustions that need to be answered at this stage:

1. What is the domain that the ontology will cover?
	
	The domain of the ontology is that of databases and related concepts like 
	the following:
		* data models;
		* storage models;
		* transactions;
		* replication mechanisms;
		* licensing;
		* etc.
	
2. For what are we going to use the ontology?
	
	We plan to use this ontology for applications that suggest optimal databases
	recommendations to use, subject to certain constraints (e.g., scalability 
	requirements, paritioning support, required data model, etc.).

3. For what types of questions should the ontology provide answers?
	
	* Which database characteristics should I consider when choosing a database?
	* What is the data model of a particular database?
	* Is MongoDB a suitable database for creating an application using the 
	  Java programming language?
	* Is MongoDB a suitable database for creating an application that stores 
	  Petabytes of data?
	* What is the best choice of data model for a particular application?
	* Which characteristics of a databse affect its appropriatness for a 
	  particular type of application?
	* Under what circumstances we see a change in the performance of a database?  
	
4. Who will use and maintain the ontology?

	* At first, the author. With time, a community.
